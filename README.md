# Design choices

My first design choice was to make the application easy to use with a single finger on a mobile phone or tablet.

This is why I chose the vertical list layout for mobile and a grid list for tablet.

For the interactions I first chose to have 2 buttons with different colors to check in and check out children. However, due to the colors of the buttons and the current status of the children, I thought it was counter intuitive. The red check out button would be active while the children has a green status of "Checked in". I wanted to make the colors match better the current status of the child.

<img src="./first-design.PNG" alt="first-design" style="zoom:50%;" />

I then chose to modify the buttons. Instead of having 2 buttons, I chose to have a single slider to check in or out children. The slider has a green color when the child is checked in and it turns red when the child is checked out. This way the user has a consistency between the button color and the current status.
I also chose to gray out the picture of the child when he is not checked in for better clarity.

I added a search field to browse through the children list more easily. It allows the user to search for a specific child using a firs name or last name.

Give us a chance to see your beautiful code! ü§© 

How to get started:
- Fork this repository
- Create a small application in React (or another agreed upon framework)
- Describe your design decisions and setup instructions in the README.md of the forked repository

The application should be able to do 3 things:
1. List children
2. Checkin a child
3. Checkout a child

There are no other requirements than that‚Äîdon't worry about design or anything like that.
